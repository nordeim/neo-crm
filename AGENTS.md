# AGENTS.md — NEO CRM

Single Next.js 16 App Router app that clones the reference CRM workspace
(`https://neo-crm-8ab2c17c.base44.app/`): dashboard, accounts, contacts,
leads, calendar, activities, reports and settings, with Prisma/SQLite
persistence, scrypt + HMAC cookie auth, and a Zustand client store.
Clone remote: `https://github.com/nordeim/neo-crm.git`; pushes go to the SSH
remote via `docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py`.

**Gate order before every push:** `bun run lint` → `bun run typecheck` →
`bun run test` (58) → `bun run build` → `bun run test:e2e` (20). There is no
hosted CI; the local gate is the only gate. `next.config.ts` sets
`ignoreBuildErrors` — the explicit `typecheck` step is what catches type
errors; never skip it.

First-run setup: `bun install && cp .env.example .env && bun run db:push &&
bun run db:seed && bun run dev`. Demo login: `sepnetflix2023@outlook.com` /
`$Abcd1234` (mirrors the reference app). **`.env` is untracked** — copy
`.env.example` and set `AUTH_SECRET` (`openssl rand -hex 32`).

## Architecture facts you would otherwise guess wrong

- **Auth is hand-rolled** (`src/lib/auth.ts`): scrypt password hashes
  (`scrypt:salt:hash`) + HMAC-SHA256 signed stateless cookie `neo_session`
  (7-day TTL). `requireSession()` + the `isGuarded()` narrowing helper guard
  every route handler; the `(app)` route-group layout redirects unauthenticated
  page visits. No NextAuth, no JWTs, no middleware/proxy. Login/signup are
  rate-limited 10 attempts/IP/15 min (`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`, per-process).
- **API envelope is `{ ok, data } | { ok, error: { code, message } }`** — build
  responses with `ok()` / `fail()` / `ERR.*` from `src/lib/api.ts`. The store's
  `call()` helper (`src/stores/crm-store.ts`) is the only sanctioned client.
- **All server state lives in one Zustand store** — no React Query, no SWR.
  `AppShell` calls `hydrate()` once on mount (resolves `/api/auth/me`, then
  fetches every slice). Actions call the API, then refresh affected slices.
- **`useEffect` never calls setState synchronously** (React 19 lint rule is an
  ERROR here). Patterns in use: dialogs remount their form via `key`
  (`entity-dialogs.tsx`) with `useState` initializers; the mobile nav closes on
  route change via adjust-during-render; debounced search yields with
  `await Promise.resolve()` before touching state. Follow them.
- **Tailwind CSS v4 is CSS-first** — all tokens are literal hex in the
  `@theme` block of `src/app/globals.css`. No `tailwind.config.js` (it would be
  ignored). `postcss.config.mjs` MUST keep the `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin —
  without it `@theme`/`@utility` directives are never compiled and pages
  render unstyled (this exact bug shipped once; see
  `docs/Tailwind-V4-Validation-Report.md`).
- **`tw-animate-css` is vendored at `src/app/vendor/tw-animate.css`** — the
  npm package exposes only the `style` export condition, which Turbopack's CSS
  resolver does not support (`Can't resolve 'tw-animate-css'`). Import the
  local file; do not switch back to the package import.
- **SQLite path normalization** (`src/lib/db-path.ts`, pinned by
  `tests/db-path.test.ts`): relative `file:` URLs resolve against
  `prisma/schema.prisma` — the same rule as the Prisma CLI — so the CLI,
  `next dev`, and the standalone build all land on `<repo>/db/custom.db`
  regardless of the process working directory. Two hazards are handled
  there: (1) **bun rewrites relative `file:` DATABASE_URL values loaded
  from `.env` into absolute paths resolved against the `.env` file's own
  directory** — with the root contract `file:../db/custom.db` that is one
  directory OUTSIDE the repo; `runtimeDatabaseUrl()` detects exactly that
  signature and re-anchors on the schema rule. (2) First boot: validated
  anchors `mkdir -p` the `db/` folder instead of falling through to the
  raw relative URL. `db:push` routes through the `scripts/prisma-env.ts`
  wrapper so the Prisma CLI gets the same treatment. Always import `db`
  from `@/lib/db`; never construct `PrismaClient` directly.
- **Schema changes use `db push`, not migrations** (`prisma/migrations/` does
  not exist). `bun run db:seed` is idempotent — it wipes domain tables and
  reseeds IN PLACE (never delete the `.db` file itself; a running server keeps
  reading the deleted inode — this bit the e2e suite once).
- **The mobile navigation drawer is a deliberate fix** — the reference app
  hides its sidebar below `lg` and ships no replacement, leaving phone users
  stranded. `src/components/layout/mobile-nav.tsx` is the drawer: focus trap,
  Escape, body scroll-lock, close-on-route-change, `inert` +
  `visibility:hidden` when closed. `tests/e2e/mobile-navigation.spec.ts`
  (5 checks) is the regression suite — do not weaken it.
- **File downloads use `downloadFile()`** (`src/lib/download.ts`) — a single
  centralized `window.location.href` for `Content-Disposition: attachment`
  responses. Next's `no-location-assign` lint rule fires on raw assignments;
  don't inline them again.
- **Status vocabularies are distinct** — never mix them. Lead stages, account
  statuses, activity types/statuses, event types/statuses, contact priorities
  each have canonical label/color metadata in `src/lib/constants.ts`
  (`STAGE_META`, `ACCOUNT_STATUS_META`, `ACTIVITY_TYPE_META`,
  `EVENT_TYPE_META`, `PRIORITY_META`). Extend the meta maps when you extend a
  vocabulary.
- **Pure domain seams are unit-tested** (`src/lib/db-path.ts`, `auth.ts`,
  `format.ts`, `csv.ts`, `rate-limit.ts` — 58 Vitest checks). Route handlers
  and pages import these modules; don't inline their logic. E2E uses its own
  scratch database (`db/e2e.db` via `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts`, in-place
  reseed) on port 3100 against the standalone build.

## Conventions that differ from defaults

- TypeScript strict **except `noImplicitAny: false`** (sandbox default, kept).
- Validation is hand-rolled in route handlers (trim, length caps, enum
  membership, referential checks via `asString`/`asNumber`/`asDate` in
  `src/lib/api.ts`). No schema library — zod was deliberately pruned.
- Charts are recharts with empty-state fallbacks (`src/components/charts/`);
  every chart must render a friendly placeholder when its data is all-zero.
- Icons are lucide-react; nav chrome strokes at 1.8, content at 2.
- z-index stays on the flat scale: topbar z-40, drawer/dialogs z-50, dropdown
  portals z-[60], toasts z-[100]. No ad-hoc `z-[9999]`.
- ESLint ignores `skills/` (the operator's skill catalog, not app code) plus
  build output dirs — don't remove those ignores.

## Git

- **`main` only.** No feature branches.
- Conventional Commits with emoji prefixes: `:tada: feat: …`, `:memo: docs: …`,
  `:bug: fix: …`.
- Never commit `.env`, `*.key`, `db/*.db`, or `node_modules/` (all gitignored;
  `.env` was untracked from the scaffold's initial commit deliberately).
- Push through the SSH wrapper from the repo root:
  `PATH="/path/to/ssh-shim-dir:$PATH" python3 docs/ssh_git_wrapper_v3.py --key-file <key outside repo> --remote git@github.com:nordeim/neo-crm.git`
  — runbook: `docs/how-to-git-push-using-ssh-wrapper_SKILL.md` (the wrapper
  preflights for an `ssh` binary; sandboxes without one deploy the Appendix A
  paramiko shim on PATH first).
